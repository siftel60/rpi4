    TYPICALSETUP:
    
        -rpi4 ( 2 / 1 / 4 all are fine 8 is untested but should be fine )
        -decent 3amp(2.5) psu ( external switch/button very handy )
        -small heatsink minimum ( fine without it tho' )
            
        -sdcard    -> Samsung EVO Plus 32GB microSDXC UHS-I Class 10
         (note: 2 cards are beneficial)

        -anyone who seriously needs wireless should use a seperate ap
            ( ipq806x / unify ap's / tp-link 225/245 recommended )

        -WAN-Ethernet: For best results use a usb nic rtl-8152-3 / asix-ax88179
            recommended;
            -> TP-LINK UE300 USB3
            
        -optional-case




    WISEMOVE:

        -pre 2020 09 stable firmware is quicker... so if not using usbboot
         it is advised to stay on that firmware

        -a usb stick in the upper usb3 slot used as "backup/persistent"
         storage for anything that might not survive a failed upgrade...

        -this external extra data partition is encouraged for most
         openwrt devices with a usb slot... ( as is images that
         contain the required packages / drivers to access this
         data on a fresh install i.e. block-mount e2fsprogs etc. )
         these packages should be contained in this build...
