    DETAILED NOTES / BUGS / CAVEATS:


        PHILOSOPHY: 
        
        Originally the build aimed to provide snapshot/master
        with stable package repos, several built-in utilities
        and services ( default-off where applicable to keep
        it light ), and a few setup / helper scripts...

        The build has evolved more toward a full feature
        ext4 only build. And while original versions were
        aimed at interoperability with a stock-official-image
        this becomes less the case as time goes by...

        ... as such I recommend installing this build fresh
        and taking care if restoring 'official' backups
        or vice-versa across core versions...

        Most things will work... but there are specific
        considerations and tools for this purpose...


        As the a stable openwrt (21/22.x?) looms near the build
        is likely to become a little less generalised and
        refined.


        Feedback and requests are always welcome...
        even better with good justifications and minimal
        impact to OOB operations, or appeal to the masses,
        or expand functionality...


        Uncommon requests are put to
        the 3 or 5 build user test ( 20% interest )



        -see TODO

        -/root in its entirety should not be part of your sysupgrade.conf
         ( community > community ) individual files and directories will
         be ok... efforts are underway to overcome this...


        -using sysupgrade -n has never been tested you'd assume that
         it would leave you with something similar to a factory install
         although i suspect there would be a glitch or two... lucklily...
         zapping a new factory to an sdcard is an equivalent workaround

        -extroot/overlay will/may cause issues for some script logix...
         only use this if you are prepared to report logs / are an
         intermediate user or above... as these make upgrading difficult
         anyway, its recommended you just point service config to a
         usb-mount where applicable this saves the hassle of pkgdata
         on upgrade and is handled (reasonable) transparently
         Can fix extroot-overlay underlying issues if someone capable
         reports the problems, would likely effect, packagerestore
         upgrade, backup etc logix


        -luci_statistics will fail to start if collectd-mod-x is not
         installed and is enabled in /etc/config/luci_statistics > module,
         as firstboot scripts setup these modules... and sysupgrade
         auto-removes packages you have removed... i'd suggest just leaving
         all modules installed for now and possibly cp statistics config
         file pre/post upgrade if you want to disable some default modules...


        -rc.local style scripts should be placed in /etc/custom/startup ...
         see examples there and make sure to add to sysupgrade.conf avoid
         editing rc.local but if there is a real need ask on the support page
         and we'll work something out...


        -sdcard writes... unlike a stock image, this build makes use of sdcard
         storage to keep traffic / statistical data across reboots. if you are
         averse to any disk writes, you can disable this option. given the cost
         of sdcards, the infrequency of reboots, and the utility of persisent
         data ... this is generally a functional win.
         if you wish to store your data somewhere other than the default...
         like an attached usb device... you should also disable this...

        -procps-ng-{ps,df,top?} will likely create issues with some of the custom
         scripts within the build, avoid installing them or discuss on the forum
         tar, gzip
        
        
        
        
        ####################### oldmsgs

        20201110
                -master has been fairly volatile of late... no builds currently...
                         and for forseeable future ( few weeks minimum )



		NOTE: 20201109 changes in master have placed a cloud around the operation
              of opkg install from non-core/luci/base feeds ( and inconsistency
              from imagebuilder ) .... until confidence is restored in it's
              reliability... any opkg operations which are discussed below...
              may not be considered reliable... this also means that the frequency
               / availability of 'stable' builds will be affected...
