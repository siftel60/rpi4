        (well, moderate to advanced users with manual and dd backups
        should be ok?)

        SIMPLIFIED NOTES

            -best to use another disk or dd backup your mmc ( plus normal backups as usual )

            -novice-users / anyone using the build in a production capacity are advised
             wait for a week or two or use factory only on newdisk

            -non-factory installation (sysupgrade) and wish to switch disk around later
             update cmdline.txt with root=PARTUUID=abcdefgh-0N
             AFTER install: blkid $(findmnt /)

            -backup restore from alternate disk or old above applies ( before reboot )
             (note: of you started on mmc flash this and stay on mmc then root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 if fine )

            -use a low power requirement usb disk if using on usb

            -see forum-post/rpi-documentation re: boot-order... by default... the mmc needs to
             be removed in order to attempt to load from usb drive
            
            -if you get no boot and have no serial plug into a pc -> fsck ->
             mount fatpart1/boot -> check your PARTUUID / cmdline.txt
             mmc@dev root= are fine if all that is used but dont rely
             on them for /dev/sdX




        KNOWN-ISSUES:
            -argon theme splash page intermittent on reboot
            -sqm may not start on firstboot/boot





        !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
        IMPORTANT: build users running pre r15599 releases are advised to update
        ( or check dnsmasq version is above 2.82 -> above 2.83 for logspamfix )

    ################################################## builds



    WHAT-IS-IT?: these are disk images of openwrt for the rpi-4... see thread
                 or ../README for installation tips... they are based on
                 snapshot and include;

                 -common drivers ( usb nic / lte / etc. )
                 -luci + luci-theme-argon
                 -applications
                 -some installation/setup tweaks and customisations


        20201123

            -trial of two build variants...
                 * 'extra/full' and
                 * 'std/basic' for now...
             
             recommended to use the 'extra/full' as these will likely throw out
             the packagesrestore logic and there are no markers within the image
             re: variant... ( note: if you did a fresh install with the std/basic
             variant and always use this variant then above would not apply )


        "sys" = sysupgrade
        "fac" = factory


    
        any folder labelled beta,testing,unstable etc... can be ignored unless you are feeling
        lucky...

        upgrading on each (stable) release is not really beneficial unless you are feeling lucky,
        need a feature, are a power user or would like to help with testing / ironing out bugs...



        history seems to indicate that every 5-10 builds or so there are enough changes either to
        community package-set/features or official code to justify upgrading...
        or ~r14xxx(yourversion)+100-250

        'elfdat' = raspiOS-64 current stable bootfiles which are required to support usb
        boot. they should work ok with older firmware but until confirmed... they will remain
        labelled as such...
        NOTE: @20201129+ no confirmed issues so all builds contain updated elf-dat files
